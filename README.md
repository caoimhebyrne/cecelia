## cecelia

A very simple hobby scripting language, designed for ease-of-use and type-safety.

### Usage

**`main.cec`**:

```
//     Typing is optional here, as it will be inferred at compile-time.
//     â†“
let x: Integer = 5
let y: Integer = 6

// A top-level return statement will be treated as the process' exit code.
return x + y
```
